# Goal: Favor composition over inheritance. Bloch Item 16.

Submit via Blackboard.
Assignment:

Consider the InstrumentedSet example from Bloch Item 16 (as well as in-class exercise #21).

    Replace sets with collections. equals() no longer satisfies its contract.
        Explain why there is a problem.
        Demonstrate the problem with a suitable JUnit test. 
    Now consider the example:
        With lists.
        With maps. 
    In either case, is there a problem with equals()? If so, give a JUnit test. If not, why not? If you're not sure, simply run the code. 



Grading Criteria:

    Followed directions.
    Correct yes/no answers.
    Reasonable JUnit tests.
    Reasonable explanations.
    The GTA can easily navigate your solution.
