	1.Correct yes/no answers. 

	InstrumentedSets and ForwardingSets saitfy all the equals properties. 

	Are the equality properties broken when replacing Sets With collections ?: 
	A/ Yes. 
	Are the equality properties broken when replacing Sets With Lists or Maps ?: 
	A/ No.

	2.Explanation: 






	Example: 

	When we run the Junit Theories with the above data points the following will fail 

	HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1,2));
	InstrumentedCollection<String> Icoll = new InstrumentedCollection<>(a); 

	note: HashSet equals check that the object being compared is of type HashSet 

	Symmetry Test: 
	Icoll.equals(hs) // returns True |calls s.equals(hs) in forwarding class where s and hs are both hashSets 
	hs.equals(Icoll) // returns False|calls hs.equals(Icoll) in HashSet class determines that Ihs is a collection returnig False 
	------------------
	Broken 

	Reflexive Test: 
	Icoll.equals(Icoll) // returns False| calls s.equals(Icoll) in forwarding class therefore we run into same problem as above 
	------------------
	Broken
